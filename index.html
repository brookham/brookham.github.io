          <p class="card-text"><h4>Bio/about section</h4>
            <p>My name is Brook Hamilton and i have many interests that include rafting, climbing, snowboarding, and really anything else involving the outdoors. because the outdoors is so important to me and my interests, I would love to be able to take part in something that somehow helps to improve outdoor spaces in a way that is beneficial to so many people and will help to enable more people to engage in outdoor activities. and i would love to do this through the world of computer science as that is something i am very passionate about.

            <h4>Relevant experience</h4>
            <p>i have a little experience in working on small coding projects in school both as part of a team and independently.
            </p>   
            <h4>Relevant skills</h4>
            <p>Although my experience is relatively limited, I have picked up some good skills such as a good ability to multitask, good communication skills, and an ability to function very well while working with a team. all of these skills i have picked up and sharpened through my job as a server at Pastini. while serving it is very important to multitask in order to not have any tables be forgotten about and make sure all customers are happy, it is also key to communicate with and support team members to ensure that all staff is successful.
